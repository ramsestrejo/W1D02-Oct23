# The Dev Workflow - or Taking off as a Dev

Today we explored the Monty Hall Game and how to simulate it programmatically. It was a nice feeling that we were able to test our hypothesis that players of the game double their chances of winning by just switching their original choice. 

We did not put too much focus on syntax, libraries nor programming style. We looked at a problem, analyzed it and broke it down into smaller problems and came up with an algorithm that would simulate the game and prove or disprove or hypothesis. We first created a brand new repository in GitHub and cloned it t our local environment. We debugged issues along the way, fixed authentication issues, interpreted stacktraces, fixed our logic, corrected typos, and then we created functions to functionally group and consolidate our pieces of code. 


After the code changes were complete, I proceeded to commit and push my code with the following instructions:
```
git status .
git add .
git commit -m "Adding code that programmatically simulates the game and comfirms player 2 winning 66% of the time"
git push 
```
